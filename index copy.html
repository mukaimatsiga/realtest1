    <h3>Color Journal Entry:</h3>
  </section>
  <section class="p1">
    <p>
      <p>When should we use text for colors compared to HEX? <li>HEX helps us find more specific colors - text is quicker</li>
      <li>HEX color values give us more options to be more specific when choosing a color for our site</li>
      <li>I decided to download the colorpicker package on Atom which has made color selection a lot easier</li>
      <p>HEX for black: <li>#000 or #000000</li></p>
      <p>HEX for white: <li>#fff or #ffffff</li></p>
      It's easier to read HEX values in lower case rather than upper case, however it is easiest to copy and paste the values from a tool
